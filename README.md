# What my project do
### My project reads the data from a file that contains json data about movie quotes using the Reader class then parse it to an array of objects (Quote). then my code select a random index between 0 and 138 (length of the array) and return the Quote object with that index.After that I print out specific properties as required, these properties is the author,likes and text.
